# Ayag

Ayag is a simple program that displays notifications after a
specified amount of time (at the time of this writing, the time is fixed to 20 minutes). Its main purpose is to remind the user of the 20/20/20 rule of computer usage.

## Supported Platforms
Ayag has only been tested against **Mac OS** Monterey, but it should theoretically run on **Linux** as well.
